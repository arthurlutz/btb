"Prison and crime are difficult subjects which impact people in very deep "
"and\n"
"personal ways.  Emotions often run high and hot when dealing with those who\n"
"have caused harm to others, or who feel they have been wronged.  People in\n"
"prison often feel powerless and crushed by a system that does little to "
"help\n"
"them, and victims of crimes often feel angry and vengeful toward those who "
"hurt\n"
"them.  \n"

"These guidelines aim to help us foster a positive community to help\n"
"<em>everyone</em> involved by dealing with the issues in constructive ways.\n"

"We encourage you to engage with the difficult subject of incarceration "

"do so within these rules:\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"

"    <li>No hate speech.</li>\n"
"    <li>No personal attacks.</li>\n"

"    <li><em>Do</em> challenge yourself to speak constructively.</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
